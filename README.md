# Tower Defense VR


<p>A small project with Google Cardboard SDK in Unity.<br>
Almost every asset(except some Particle Systems) is made by myself using Blender and Photoshop.<br>
I made this game during my summer holiday and while making this game, I learned to work with Unity in a 3D environement.<br>
This game is highly inspired by a VR game called Castle Must Be Mine.</p>
